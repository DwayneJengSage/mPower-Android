        <p style="padding-top:15px;"><span class="boldie">1. Sign up for an Account</span><br/>To
            sign up for an account
            you must first complete a consent process explaining the risks and benefits of the study
            and also confirm
            your agreement to participate in the study. Afterward we will ask you to create an
            account, and verify your
            email address and other general information about you. </p>

        <p><span class="boldie">2. Complete Health Surveys</span><br/> We will ask you to answer
            questions about yourself, your medical history, and your current health. We will ask if
            you have Parkinson disease and if you take certain medications. In addition we will ask
            you daily, weekly and monthly questions about your symptoms. Because the purpose of this
            study is to look for patterns over time, we will ask you to review and update your
            answers from time to time. We might also ask new questions about your mood or how well
            you slept. These questions are important for the research study.</p>

        <p><span class="boldie">3. Complete Simple Activities</span><br/>We will ask you to do
            simple activities while holding or using your mobile. For example:</p>
        <ul style="padding-left:25px;">
            <li>Say &quot;aaah&quot; for 10 seconds into your Phone to record variations in your
                voice.
            </li>
            <li>Walk back and forth for 30 seconds or standing still with your phone in your pocket
                to assess your gait and balance.
            </li>
            <li>Tap on the phone screen repeatedly to test your motor speed and coordination.</li>
            <li>Play a short pattern game to assess your short-term memory.</li>
            <li>Hold your phone for 10-15 seconds to measure tremor in your hand.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These activities should take you about 20 minutes a day.<br/><br/>

            You may choose to act at your convenience, participate in all or only in some parts of
            the study.<br/><br/>

            You can enable notifications from the app to receive reminders to do these surveys and
            activities.
